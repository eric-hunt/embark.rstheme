# What's Embark?

First of all, a big thank you to the creators of the [Embark theme](https://embark-theme.github.io/), which is described as:

> A deep inky purple theme leveraging bright colors. Designed to reduce visual clutter and help you focus on your code.
>
> **A Theme for the *ambitious*.**

I'm inclined to agree. :smirk:

I've personally enjoyed using the Embark theme's ports to _Vim_ and _Alacritty_. Since I use _RStudio_ pretty much every day as well, I wanted to contribute to the theme and share it with others. The only way I knew how to do this was through the use of the theme building utilities provided by @gadenbuie in the `rsthemes` R package. So..

# What's `rsthemes`?

[`rsthemes`](https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes) is an R package that provides

> :crystal_ball: Full RStudio IDE and Syntax Themes

The package not only provides an extensive set of themes to beautify your RStudio experience, but also provides tools to create your own themes.

I am indebted to the many contributors to this curated arsenal of harmonious colors that make staring at R code a much more pleasant experience. My goal is to submit this theme to be merged into the `rsthemes` package once I get most of the kinks worked out, but in the meantime, if you want to try it out you can install this R package from GitHub with:

```{r}
#| eval: false
if (!require(rsthemes)) remotes::install_github("gadenbuie/rsthemes")
remotes::install_github("eric-hunt/embark.rstheme")
embark.rstheme::embark_rstheme(install = TRUE)
```

Or, you can just download the .rstheme file and import it within RStudio:
